# MIPS
MIPS is a type of microprocessor architecture that utilizes a reduced instruction set computing (RISC) approach.

RISC processors typically have a load-store architecture. This means there are two instructions for accessing memory: a load (l) instruction to load data from memory and a store (s) instruction to write data to memory. It also means that none of the other instructions can access memory directly. So, an instruction like "add this byte from memory to register 1" from a CISC instruction set would need two instructions in a load-store architecture: "load this byte from memory into register 2" and "add register 2 to register 1".
